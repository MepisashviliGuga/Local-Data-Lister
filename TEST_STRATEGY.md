# Test Strategy Document

## Project: Local Data Lister

### 1. Objectives

- Ensure the reliability, correctness, and usability of the Local Data Lister application.
- Detect defects early and ensure all features meet requirements.
- Maintain high code quality and user experience through automated and manual testing.

### 2. Scope

- All backend and frontend code, including API endpoints, UI components, and integration points.
- Static data handling, search/filter features, and caching mechanisms.
- User interface and user experience flows.

### 3. Types of Testing

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Backend: Test data models, utility functions, and API logic (Jest).
  - Frontend: Test React components and hooks (React Testing Library).
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Backend: Test API endpoints and data flow (Jest).
  - Frontend: Test user flows and component interactions (React Testing Library).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
  - Test complete user journeys and critical paths (Cypress).
- **Performance Testing:**
  - Test API and search performance under load (Jest, custom scripts, or Cypress).
- **Manual Testing:**
  - Exploratory and usability testing by team members.

### 4. Tools & Frameworks

- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing for backend and frontend.
- **React Testing Library**: Frontend component and integration testing.
- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing.
- **TypeScript**: Type safety in tests and code.

### 5. Test Data

- Use static JSON or TypeScript files for local items (restaurants, parks, events).
- Cover edge cases: empty fields, long names, special characters, missing/invalid data.
- Store reusable test data in `tests/` or `cypress/fixtures/`.

### 6. Test Coverage

- Target at least 80% code coverage for unit and integration tests.
- All critical features and user flows must have automated tests.
- Coverage reports generated with `npm run test:coverage`.

### 7. Test Execution

- Run all tests before each commit and pull request.
- Use CI/CD to run tests on every push to main and feature branches.
- E2E tests run before major releases or deployments.

### 8. Responsibilities

- **Giorgi**: Test strategy, backend unit/integration tests, performance tests.
- **Dato**: Frontend component/integration tests, E2E tests.
- **Guga**: Test data creation, E2E tests, performance/load tests.
- All: Manual and exploratory testing, code reviews, maintaining test quality.

### 9. Reporting & Defect Management

- Use Jest and Cypress reports for tracking test results.
- Log defects in GitHub Issues or project management tool.
- Review and triage defects in daily standups.

### 10. Maintenance

- Update tests and data as features evolve.
- Refactor tests for clarity and maintainability.
- Remove obsolete or redundant tests regularly.
