# Test Strategy Document

## 1. Introduction

*   This document outlines the test strategy for the "Local Data Lister" project, a data-driven application that displays local information (restaurants, parks, events) with search functionality and caching mechanisms. The goal is to ensure the application's reliability, performance, security, usability, and accessibility through a comprehensive testing approach.

## 2. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Backend API functionality (data retrieval, search, filtering, sorting, caching).
    *   Frontend user interface components and user interactions.
    *   Data validation and integrity.
    *   Performance of API endpoints and search functionality.
    *   Accessibility of the user interface.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   Third-party API integrations (assumed to be reliable, but their usage will be tested).
    *   Infrastructure-level testing (e.g., network configuration).

## 3. Testing Levels

*   **3.1 Unit Testing**
    *   **Description:** Unit tests will focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation. This includes data models, API endpoint logic, frontend components, and utility functions.
    *   **Tools and Frameworks:** Jest (for both backend and potentially some frontend components).
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Test each function/component with a variety of inputs, including edge cases and invalid data.
        *   Mock external dependencies to isolate the unit under test.
    *   **Coverage Goal:** Aim for >80% code coverage for critical modules.

*   **3.2 Integration Testing**
    *   **Description:** Integration tests will verify the interaction between different modules and components. This includes testing API endpoints with database interactions, frontend components interacting with the backend, and the caching mechanism.
    *   **Tools and Frameworks:** Jest (for backend), React Testing Library (for frontend).
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Test data flow between components.
        *   Verify that API endpoints correctly handle requests and responses.
        *   Test the caching mechanism to ensure data is cached and retrieved correctly.

*   **3.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing**
    *   **Description:** End-to-end tests will simulate real user scenarios to ensure the application functions correctly from start to finish. This includes testing user login, search functionality, filtering, sorting, pagination, and data display.
    *   **Tools and Frameworks:** Cypress.
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Write tests that mimic user actions, such as navigating to different pages, entering search queries, and interacting with UI elements.
        *   Verify that the application displays the correct data and behaves as expected.

## 4. Testing Types

*   **4.1 Functional Testing**
    *   **Description:** Functional testing will verify that the application meets its functional requirements. This includes testing all features and ensuring they work as expected.
    *   **Approach:** Test cases will be based on the user stories and requirements specifications.

*   **4.2 Performance Testing**
    *   **Description:** Performance testing will evaluate the application's responsiveness, stability, and scalability under various load conditions.
    *   **Tools:** JMeter, k6 (to be determined based on ease of use and reporting capabilities).
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Load tests to simulate a large number of concurrent users.
        *   Stress tests to push the application beyond its limits.
        *   Performance tests to measure response times and resource utilization.
    *   **Goals:** Define acceptable response times for API endpoints and search functionality.

*   **4.3 Security Testing**
    *   **Description:** Security testing will identify vulnerabilities in the application that could be exploited by attackers.
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Static code analysis to identify potential security flaws.
        *   Penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks.
        *   Vulnerability scanning to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Considerations:** Secure storage of API keys and sensitive data. Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).

*   **4.4 Usability Testing**
    *   **Description:** Usability testing will evaluate how easy the application is to use and understand.
    *   **Approach:**
        *   User testing sessions with target users.
        *   Heuristic evaluation by usability experts.
        *   Gather feedback on the user interface and user experience.

*   **4.5 Accessibility Testing**
    *   **Description:** Accessibility testing will ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
    *   **Approach:**
        *   Automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., Axe).
        *   Manual testing using screen readers and other assistive technologies.
        *   Compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).

## 5. Test Environment

*   **Description:**
    *   **Development Environment:** Local development environments for each developer (using Docker or similar for consistency).
    *   **Staging Environment:** A staging environment that mirrors the production environment for testing and QA.
    *   **Production Environment:** The live environment where the application is deployed.
*   **Database Considerations:**
    *   Use separate databases for development, staging, and production.
    *   Use test data sets in the development and staging environments.
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   Manage environment-specific configurations using environment variables.

## 9. Test Data Management

*   Test data will be created and managed in separate data sets for unit, integration, and E2E tests.
*   Data will be representative of real-world data and include edge cases and invalid data.
*   Data will be stored in JSON files or databases (depending on the test level).
*   Sensitive data will be anonymized or masked.

## 10. Conclusion
